                It is a long established fact that a reader will be <br>
                distracted by the readable content of a page when <br>
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum <br>
                is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of <br>
                letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content <br>
                here', making it look like readable English. Many <br>
                desktop publishing packages and web page editors <br>
                now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, <br>
                and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many <br>
                web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have <br>
                evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, <br>
                sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the <br>
                like). <br>
